This project aims to provide comprehensive insights into a store's 2019 sales performance, uncovering key trends, patterns, and metrics. Additionally, it will address specific questions concerning profitability, monthly performance, and optimal marketing focus.

### Key Questions:

1. **Profitability**: Is the claim of losses in April, May, June, and July accurate?

2. **Monthly Performance**: What is the overall monthly sales trend throughout 2019? Are there any notable peaks or dips?

3. **Marketing Optimization**: Does data support the Assistant Manager's suggestion to prioritize marketing efforts in Los Angeles, New York, Atlanta, San Francisco, and Seattle? Should this strategy be pursued?
